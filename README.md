# Presagen  - AI Enhance Healthcare
The field of women’s health has been around for millennia. [Femtech](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/the-dawn-of-the-femtech-revolution) is an underserved industry from investment and technology perspective. There is a range of areas such as Fertility , Breast Screening, Female Incident Cancers, Obstreics & Gynacology  where AI can have profound imapact on woman's health outomce. 

Personal experience, especially a traumatic one, can often be a catalyst for striving to make positive change in the world.
For **Dr Michelle Perugini**, her own struggle with fertility was a motivation for combining her passions for healthcare and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to improve pregnancy rates for women undergoing IVF.

Competitors for Life Whsiprer are [AIVF](https://aivf.co/), [Fairtility](https://fairtility.com/), [Alife](https://www.alifehealth.com/) 

The field of fertility treatments is experiencing a surge in demand, fueled by several significant factors. A shift towards starting families at a later age, the increasing number of same-sex couples seeking assistance, and concerning studies revealing a decline in male fertility are all contributing to this trend. According to the Pew Research Center, the use of fertility treatments to assist with the birth process in the US has more than tripled from 1996 to 2015.

There are 3 main types of [fertility treatment:](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/infertility/treatment/)
   - Medicines

- Surgical procedures

-   Asisted conception –
    - Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)

        IUI is a simple office procedure that places sperm, collected from the partner and processed in the laboratory, into the uterine cavity

    - In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)

        - A form of [ART](https://www.cdc.gov/art/index.htm) (assisted reproductive technology) in which a man’s sperm and a woman’s eggs are combined outside of the body in a laboratory dish

        - A woman receives medications to stimulate her ovaries to develop multiple follicles with eggs

        - A minor procedure under sedation uses transvaginal ultrasound to aspirate the follicles and obtain the eggs followed by same day sperm insemination

        - Monitoring embryo growth to determine the optimal day & embryo(s) for transfe

One in four couples in developing countries is impacted by infertility. About 48.5 million couples experience infertility worldwide. [Today, infertility is rapidly becoming an epidemic.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ganeskesari/2022/06/30/heres-how-ai-is-helping-make-babies-by-revolutionizing-ivf/?sh=709941bb7330)

The global In vitro [fertilization market size](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/in-vitro-fertilization-market) was valued at USD 25.3 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.54% from 2024 to 2030 

Although IVF has been a widely used technique for over four decades, its outcomes remain unpredictable. Furthermore, access to fertility care remains dishearteningly low. In developed markets such as the United States, only 2% of individuals grappling with infertility have used IVF as a solution.

**Challagnes with IVF**

> When we had our first cycle of IVF we just assumed it would work. You read all those 'miracle baby' stories in the media but you rarely hear about the people who weren't successful.

- **Decision making about embryos, their disposition** : Currently, an embryologist uses a standard grading system to assess the appearance of each embryo under the microscope. Two embryologists could score an embryo differently based on their experience. Different systems had previously been proposed to refine this but, so far, none of them has significantly improved embryo selection.
    >“There is no real standardization of embryo assessment,” says Dr. Nikica Zaninovic, the director of the embryology lab at Weill Cornell Medicine

-   **Incrrease Risk of multiple pregnancies**: [Multiple births](https://www.cdc.gov/art/key-findings/multiple-births.html#:~:text=Multiple%20births%E2%80%94the%20delivery%20of,one%20embryo%20during%20the%20procedure.) primarily result from transfer of more than one embryo during the procedure

- **Low Success rate**:
        - Live births per first embryo transfer is 41.4% as per [SART](https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx)
       - 
       - Currently, birth rates from IVF vary widely, from 31% for women age 35 and under to around 3% for women age 42 and older when using fresh embryos, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC](https://nccd.cdc.gov/drh_art/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DRH_ART.ClinicInfo&rdRequestForward=True&ClinicId=9999&ShowNational=1)
       
- Due to low success rate, many women ultimately have to go through **multiple rounds of IVF**.

- An IVF cycle involves stimulating the ovaries with hormones, retrieving eggs, fertilizing those eggs with sperm in a lab and then transferring the resulting embryo or embryos to the uterus. One cycle can take several weeks and runs $12,000 on average before the cost of medications. For a lot of patients, it’s ***Cost-Prohibitive*** to have multiple cycles

- Mutliple cyclyes makes the process can be **time-consuming, [emotionally exhausting.](https://www.sart.org/patients/a-patients-guide-to-assisted-reproductive-technology/general-information/preparing-for-ivf-emotional-considerations/)**

    >Patients have rated the stress of undergoing IVF as more stressful than or almost as stressful as any other major life event, such as the death of a family member or separation or divorce. 




With a focus on improving Women's Health outcomes globally, Presagen's first product, Life Whisperer, is being used by IVF clinics globally to improve pregnancy outcomes for couples struggling with fertility. With a vision of creating the largest network of clinics, patients, and medical data from around the world, Presagen is driving the future of AI Enhanced Healthcare.

Life Whisperer is a world-leader in the application of AI in IVF. The Life Whisperer Genetics AI-based embryo assessment tool is the first to be commercialized in a series of applications that encompass the complete IVF journey. Life Whisperer aims to improve IVF success rates at every point and, as a result, reduce time-to-pregnancy, making IVF more affordable and accessible to patients globally. 

**Life Whisperer is being used in IVF clinics around the world.**

Presagen has a unique model of engagement whereby it co-creates AI software with a global co-operative cohort of data contributors, such as medical and research institutes. The Presagen platform ensures that each medical institute’s data safely remains local and isolated in the country or region of origin. AI that is developed is then commercialised by Presagen using its pre-built drag and drop, cloud-based patient diagnostics application, providing a way for those data contributors to monetise their data through ongoing revenue sharing from the commercial success of the product.  

>Presagen Co-Founder Dr Don Perugini says “this is our way of mobilising data for the benefit of both institutes and patients that would otherwise remain in the clutches of individual institutes where it is of little value. This allows us to create effective AI and share back the value with data contributors whilst solving critical image-based medical diagnostics problems.” 

How ?

 Life Whisperer is delivered to clinics via a scalable web-based tool and can be easily accessed on-demand by any clinic globally. 

During the IVF process, eggs are fertilized and develop into embryos. At this point, a clinician (embryologist) needs to decide which embryo to transfer into the patient. Manual selection of embryos is difficult, highly subjective, and limited to what the eye can see down a microscope. Other approaches to selecting embryos include genetic screening (PGS) which is costly, risky, and invasive, or time-lapse imaging which requires specialized hardware and is ineffective in detecting embryo viability.

 Life Whisperer uses deep learning AI and computer vision to support the clinician to identify the most viable embryo with the highest likelihood of success.

Life Whisperer’s AI was created by training image recognition algorithms on a large dataset of embryo images with matched pregnancy outcomes. The trained AI can effectively assess and identify morphological features that constitute a viable embryo. The Life Whisperer tool allows clinicians to drag and drop single images of patient embryos taken immediately prior to transfer and returns an instant report as to the viability of each embryo to support the clinician’s decision about which embryo to transfer. 

Unlike other solutions, Life Whisperer’s web-based approach is non-invasive, does not require specialized hardware, requires little process change in the clinic, and can be delivered at a low cost to patients.
In a recent clinical study of 598 patients Life Whisperer performed over 30% better than world-leading clinicians in accurately identifying embryo viability.




**Embryo Evaluation and Selection Process using Life Whisper**
A blastocyst stage embryo is imaged on Day 5 after IVF
The image is then drag-and-dropped onto the Life Whisperer website
A sequence of validated AI systems then run. Using object detection, and focusing on different regions of the image, there are two AI scores that are displayed
In real time, within 10 to 15 seconds, the platform returns a report which helps the doctor select the most viable embryos for implantation. The report also gives patients a window into the assessment process being used to guide their treatment.

Combined use of **two AI algorithms** for evaluating embryo quality

- **Life Whisperer Viability** gives a score, Viability Score, from 0 to 10, which is related to the likelihood the embryo will lead to a clinical pregnancy. This means, a foetal heartbeat is measured at the 6 week ultrasound scan.Each score tells you about the likelihood of a pregnancy. For low scores, there is less chance (but still some chance) of a pregnancy. This is useful for expectation setting and planning with the patient 

    >A high score of 9.1 out of 10 means a 65% chance of pregnancy – the highest chance possible without knowing more about patient factors, such as endometriosis.
        
    Life Whisperer Viability uses a combination of 4 feature classification neural networks. A single image can have some regions that are correlated with high quality, and some with low quality, and the AI takes this all into account to give a statistically reliable score

- **Life Whisperer Genetics** gives a separate score, Euploid score, from 0 to 10, which is related to the likelihood that the embryo has high genetic integrity, meaning it has the correct number of chromosomes, or is “euploid”. This technology is objective, is able to run instantly, and is completely non-invasive, unlike biopsies.

    >Low scoring embryos have a much higher likelihood of aneuploidy – these embryos are riskier to transfer, carrying a higher likelihood of disease or miscarriage. This is useful for counselling the patient, planning for risks and potentially considering further genetic testing to learn more. 

    Life Whisperer Genetics, uses a combination of 3 feature classification neural networks. It also looks at features that correspond to aneuploidy even though this embryo was likely to be a euploid.

    
    
    It can also rank order embryos to minimize the time to a first pregnancy by 12%, compared to manual grading methods, preserving morale that all-too-often can result in patients dropping out of their therapies. 

    Looking across many patients’ groups of embryos, the probability the top embryo is a euploid was found to be 82%.

This study is important for the IVF industry for two reasons. Firstly, it suggests that embryo quality is a function of both viability and genetic integrity, and that these provide overlapping but distinct information regarding pregnancy. Using both AI algorithms together achieves the best results.

Secondly, results show that AI imaging provides an effective approach for evaluating embryo genetic integrity. It is non-invasive, low cost and instant, and may improve outcomes when used with other methods for embryo evaluation and selection.

Features that relate to viability, non-viability, euploidy and aneuploidy are all different and both are useful in embryo selection.

Combining multiple AI technologies together can lead to synergies across the whole IVF workflow.

Computer Vision AI is objective, non-invasive, and has improved performance compared to traditional embryo grading.

**Technology**

To build the Life Whisperer machine learning algorithm, Presagen used Pytorch on AWS for deep learning and Amazon EC2 and AWS Fargate for AI training and inference. The algorithm analyzed thousands of embryo images taken from actual IVF cycles, both successful and unsuccessful. 
The information was extracted from Presagen’s globally linked clinical data platform in the AWS cloud, which securely stores data from clinics around the world.
With a distributed cloud solution, the AWS cloud offers a secure, reliable, and accessible platform with the massive amounts of computing power it takes to deliver the system in practice.

 Currently, Presagen is using Pytorch. The option could have been Tensoflow. But I could not find any compelling reasons for using Tensorflow for Presagen's Life Whisperer application.


>“The utility of tools to build AI products is only as good as your ability to target and understand the context in which you’re applying the AI – and how to best do that is an art form,” she explains. “It requires multidisciplinary experience and insight from different types of people in different disciplines to create an effective AI.”

>In the end however, Michelle Perugini says that AI is not all science — it also requires art.
